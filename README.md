# RoadDataset-TimeSeriesPrediction

Made by - Pratyakshya Bhakuni

This repository helps in performing time series prediction on Road Dataset of nearly 25Kms

Task
We are using a 10-year dataset from an IoT sensor on the road to estimate the metrics Para-9, Para-10, Para-11, Para-12, and Para-13 for year 10.

Model Used
Transformed the Data into Train and Test Dataset, by extracting 10th year data for para 9-13 for every section. We have used Light Gradient Boosting Machine for solving this problem.

Results
The RMSE value of the model is 68.76.
